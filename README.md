### Truple
- **Ordered collections of elements:** Tuples store elements in a specific order, similar to lists.
- **Immutable:** Once created, you cannot modify the elements within a tuple.
- **Enclosed in parentheses ():** Elements are separated by commas.
- **Useful for:** Representing data that shouldn't be changed (e.g., coordinates, configuration values).
### Set
- **Unordered collections of unique elements:** Sets don't guarantee the order in which elements are stored.
- **Duplicate elements are not allowed:** If you try to add a duplicate, it will be ignored.
- **Enclosed in curly braces {}:** Elements are separated by commas.
- **Useful for:** Checking membership, removing duplicates, performing set operations (union, intersection, difference).
### Dictionary
- **Unordered collections of key-value pairs:** Unlike lists and sets, dictionaries associate a value with a unique key.
- **Keys must be immutable:** This ensures efficient retrieval based on the key. Strings, numbers, or tuples are commonly used as keys.
- **Values can be of any data type:** They can be numbers, strings, lists, other dictionaries, etc.
- **Enclosed in curly braces {}:** Keys and values are separated by colons (:), with key-value pairs separated by commas.
- **Useful for:** Storing data where you need to access it by a unique identifier (e.g., phonebook, configurations).
